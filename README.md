# Project 2: Deus Ex Machina

###  CS 211: Object Oriented Programming - Spring 2024 

The purpose of this assignment is to practice using a generic class via `ArrayList`. Your task is to create a set of types for the `sublime` package. This will require an understanding of generics, interfaces, exceptions, enumerations, and two types from the Java `collections` framework, and the `westworld` package.

## Prelude

As you embark on Project 2 (P2), you're building upon the foundation laid in Project 1 (P1), with reduced complexity, where you've already started working with JSON-like strings to represent parts of a Machine within Exercise 2's (E2) Robot.

In P2, you will be tasked with extending and implementing logic in two new classes, one interface, and a test class that you'll have to implement to specfication.

To guide you through this project, we included the easter eggs in P1. The aim is to ensure that the instructions are clear and the level of difficulty is manageable. The primary focus will be on structuring your code correctly, which will account for 80% of the project. The remaining 20% will involve algorithmic challenges.

Remember, the goal here is not just to complete the task but to understand and apply Java constructs effectively. Take this opportunity to solidify your understanding and showcase your problem-solving skills in a structured and logical manner.

## ChangeLog

- None yet.

## Rules
0. **This project is an individual effort; the Honor Code applies.**
1. Do not modify the structure of the directories nor the code for the package `westworld`. 
2. You may import the following types from `java.util`: `ArrayList`, `List`; `westworld`: all. Other imports are not allowed.
3. The `main` method is no longer recommended; you will now required to put the "main" logic in unit tests.
4. Comment your code, especially any parts that are not obvious what you're doing. Consider explaining your loops and methods. 
5. Class fields should not in general be visible to other classes (unless otherwise specified). Create getter methods instead.
6. You may add your own helper methods or data fields, but they must be declared `private`.


## Testing:

You are responsible for ensuring your code functions correctly according to the description provided above. A validation checker will be made available on gradescope which will try to catch errors that would prevent the autograder from running. Passing this validation check does not guarantee that all of the required logic has been implemented correctly. You should write your own tests which exercise all of the required functionality in a variety of different situations in order to verify that your code operates as you expect it to. Code which does not compile or fails any of the validation checks may receive zero credit.

## Submission:

Submission instructions are as follows (up to **5pts** penalty for not following the below instructions).

Upload all of your source files (*.java) to the P2 assignment on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). Do not include anything else (no .class file, no blank templates, not this file, no .zip files).
At the top of each source file, include the following information in a comment: Name, gmu netID, g#, lecture section, and lab section. Include information for all group members. Here's an example:
```java
/*
* Names: Donald Knuth, Alan Turing
* netID: dknuth, aturin3
* G#: 00123456, 01101001
* Lecture section: 004, 004
* Lab section: 213, 212
*/
```

Verify your submission: Go back to Gradescope, download the files you just submitted, double-check their contents, rerun your tests. If something is wrong, you can resubmit as many times as you want before the deadline expires.
Make a backup of your files on OneDrive (use your mason account).
